GoComplex contains various mathematical operators on Complex Numbers. Unlike from the original complex number implementation in golang, we used a struct to represent Complex128 with float64 for real as well as imaginary part


Couple of things we still haven't implimented and we want to impliment are  


- [ ]  tan
- [ ]  sin
- [ ]  cosine
- [ ]  isnan
- [ ]  isinf
- [ ]  exp

operations.
